            <h1>Day 01 Challenge with Kevin Powell</h1>
            <p>
                The aim of this is to learn how CSS works so as to be able to create a responsive design that can work fine on Desktop, Laptop, Tablet and other mobile device perfectly.
            </p>

            <p>I was able to learn about how a webpage is responsive by default but it is our CSS that makes it non responsive. So it is better to know how the CSS works to be able to create a beautiful webpage.</p>

            <p><em>Thanks to Kevin Powell</em> for this training
